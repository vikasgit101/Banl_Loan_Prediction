## 📌 Overview

In this project, we develop a machine learning model to **predict loan approvals** based on attributes like income, credit history, education level, and more. The goal is to assist financial institutions in **automating loan screening** while reducing risk and human bias.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **IDE/Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- **Tools:** Excel (for initial data inspection), GitHub

---

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Records:** 614
- **Features:** 13
- **Key Variables:**
  - Gender, Marital Status, Education
  - Applicant Income, Loan Amount
  - Credit History
  - Loan_Status (Target)
